As machine learning becomes increasingly integrated into financial decision-making, ensuring fairness in data-driven models is essential. This study investigates biases in the Atlantic Bank dataset, which consists of 32,581 entries covering key financial indicators such as income levels, loan amounts, interest rates, and credit history. Using statistical parity, we assess bias across demographic groups and leverage Poisson distribution modeling to anticipate future bias trends. By applying reweighing techniques, we adjust data distributions to mitigate disparities, leading to a more ethically sound and transparent model. Our findings emphasize the necessity of proactive bias detection and correction, ensuring equitable financial opportunities and enhancing the credibility of AI-driven systems..
